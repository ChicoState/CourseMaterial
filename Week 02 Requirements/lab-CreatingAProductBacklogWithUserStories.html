<h4>Credit Union Online Portal</h4>
<p>A credit union is a financial institution that provides the same kind of services as a bank. However, unlike banks, "customers" are "members" and are not-for-profit organizations, usually meant to serve specific communities. Because credit unions are usually smaller organizations without the corporate resources that banks have, your team has dedicated volunteer time to build an open source platform that credit unions can deploy to provide <span style="text-decoration: underline;">online services that compete with online banks</span>. In this lab, we will go through the steps for specifying the requirements in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>product backlog</em></span> that the team will use in development.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Identify and list the stakeholders</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, that stakeholders to consider include people who will use the system for its intended purpose as well as those who may not.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Create a list of User Stories</strong>.</p>
<p>Each user story should be written on its own card. Follow the format:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">"<strong>As a</strong> &lt;<em>stakeholder</em>&gt;, <strong>I can</strong> &lt;<em>goal</em>&gt; &lt;<em>reason</em>&gt;."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Review and organize User Stories</strong>.</p>
<p>Stories that are broad or difficult to estimate how long they will take are "Epics." Break down Epics into multiple, specific user stories. Arrange the cards on your desks to group Epics together and show how the user stories are related to each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Prioritize User Stories</strong>.</p>
<p>Estimate how long your team would need to complete each user story and write the duration on the card. Since your team does not have the resources to complete all of the features at the same time, discuss which user stories are most vital to support for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very first release</span> of the product, which is two months away. Based on that discussion, order the features from highest priority to lowest. Keep in mind the Return on Investment (ROI).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Create a Product Backlog</strong>.</p>
<p>In a text file, list the prioritized User Stories under a section called "Features." Then, create additional sections for "Bugs" that you will leave blank for now (until bugs are discovered). Under another section, "Technical" list the initial technical requirements (such as specifics of setting up the development environments). Finally, the last section is titled "Knowledge Acquisition" which should list specific research and training/learning goals that need to be completed. Save and share your product backlog with your team.</p>
